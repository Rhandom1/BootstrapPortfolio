Project title: Bootstrap Profile Pages

The purpose of this project was to build a profile page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as much as possible. Using Bootstrap, I was able to configure three pages using the bootstrap grid system. I was able to style the page us CSS classes and id's. I used a Bootstrap navBar and used CSS to manipulate the links and header. I was able to create a sticky footer using HTML tags.

I ran the HTML through an HTML validator, but was uncertain what to do with the information it provided. Final QA showed responsive images and working links. Grammar and spell checks were issued before final deployment.
